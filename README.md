# Making a Bitcoin-based blockchain (with NO use of etherium)
# TODOS:
    [x] adding transactions in block
    [ ] Merkle root
    [ ] Removing spent transactions from UTXOS
    [ ] Removing transactions from cache
    [ ] Calculating fee
    [ ] Calculating difficult target
    [ ] Calculating block size
Nothing is worth the risk
